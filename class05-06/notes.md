Go over c64 example again:

* let's break it down
* Let's create a function that draws a line
* either this line or that line
* what kind of math do we do about characters?
* How do we draw one line by char by char?
* left to right, top to bottom

Could we modify it to do something more interesting?

* flying text

* Draw a clock that moves with you
* Coordinate systems
* rotate, size, etc.
